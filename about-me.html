      <h2>My name is Dogo and living a simple life has saved my life </h2>
      <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought
      I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was
      too much.</p>
      <p>Things were terrible. I had a job I hated, a home I didn't want to live
      in, and I couldn't hold a relationship</p>
      
      <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
      <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got a rid of everything</strong>
      I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into
      a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
      <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in a such a bad place, I
      didn't know what else to do. And it worked</p>
      
      <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
      <p>Now that I am living a simple life, things a much better. I'm less stressed,
      enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
      <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but
      to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a
      simple life as well, which is why I started this site</p>
